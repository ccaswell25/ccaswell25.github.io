### {{< fa laptop >}} Professionally

My previous experience involves designing technical solutions tohelp large organizations work more efficiently by leveraging software as a service tools.

After graduating from the University of Vermont with an undergraduate degree in Business Analytics, my goal was to work with data and gain experience understanding how businesses operate. I spent three years working as an Artificial Intelligence Solutions Consultant, which included designing and creating solutions to implement algorithms into workforce management tools. I helped Fortune 500 companies (examples included McDonald's,DoorDash, & Nike) optimize the costs associated with forecasting their demand, staffing labor, and allocating resources effectively.

With an interest in expanding my skills and working for a larger organization, I then became a Consultant for Smartsheet, a collaborative work management tool. At Smartsheet, I worked as a hybrid management and IT consultant analyzing client's existing processes and recommending and designing scalable solutions for them. I managed large project budgets, cross-functional work teams, and multi-year solution implementations. I also designed technical solutions that optimized manual processes within teams, departments, and entire organizations.

After being in the workforce for five years, I began to re-think my career goals and found myself wanting to do more impactful work. With my love for working with data and solving problems through data analysis from my time as an undergraduate, I decided to pursue my Master's degree to transition to a new line of work that is focused on data-driven sustainable solutions. My goal with this degree is, by combining my previous consulting and technology experience with my new knowledge of data science and sustainability, I can translate business questions into data science solutions to large organizations with a sustainable mission.

### {{< fa person-hiking >}} Personally

In my free time, I love to be outdoors with my dog, Kona. I am grateful to live in California where the weather allows me to be outside year round. My hobbies include trail running, hiking, yoga, surfing, skiing, and tennis. Growing up in Vermont, I loved skiing and hiking with family and friends. I now love exploring the neighboring mountains and the Sierras by skiing, hiking, and finding new trails wherever I go.

I grew up being a sprint runner, competing in cross country races across New England. In the last two years I have recently explored long distance running races, partaking in numerous half marathons and the Lake Tahoe Marathon. My next goal is to qualify for and run the 2025 Boston Marathon.
