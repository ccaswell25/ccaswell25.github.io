My name is Carly and welcome to my personal website. This site will give you an overview of my professional life, interests, and passions (both personal and work-related).

**What am I up to right now?**

I am currently a Master of Environmental Data Science student at the University of California Santa Barbara, studying to apply data science skills to real challenges facing our ever-changing climate.
