## Hello!

**What am I up to right now? Education Update!**

I recently graduated from the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California Santa Barbara, where I earned my Master's Degree in Environmental Data Science. This was an intense program where I was focused on finding applicable data science solutions for companies looking to become more environmentally sustainable, which has now become a strategic imperative. My goal in seeking this advanced degree was to learn how to use my tech skills to contribute meaningful change to our world.
