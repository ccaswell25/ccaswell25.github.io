## About This Project

-crazy fact-
This is an important problem to consider because...

I am interested in the trend of snowfall over time in Vermont and how the trend may be influencing the ski industry, Vermont's tourism economy, and potential wildlife and habitat implications that rely on snowfall to migrate and find food. Snowfall also largely helps water sources in the Spring, providing water to agriculture, wildlife, and for human consumption. I am specifically hoping to answer the question: are seasonal temperature differences causing snowfall patterns later in the year (ski resorts opening later or earlier) in Vermont? Are the more recent years of snowfall statistically significant given previous years of data?

I am also interested in the relationship between temperature changes and snowfall trends due to climate change and will be evaluating both temperature and snowfall variables in Vermont.

In this analysis I am going to....

## Analysis Highlights:

1.  Combining vector and raster data
2.  Resampling raster data using `resample` function
3.  Masking raster data using `raster` package
4.  Operations on raster data
5.  Creating interactive maps using `leaflet`
6.  Designing a function for any species

## About the Data:

I gathered daily snow depth and temperature data from the USDA\'s Natural Resources Conservation Service and National Water and Climate Center (<https://nwcc-apps.sc.egov.usda.gov/site-plots/#VT>). This data source contains two datasets:

Dataset 1 - Titled `vt_temps` , this dataset contains daily temperature data (in degrees Fahrenheit) from the years 2001 - 2023. These data points were collected from a weather station at the Mount Mansfield SCAN Site numbered 2041. Mount Mansfield is Vermont's largest mountain peak, located in the Green Mountains at an elevation of 4395'.

Dataset 2 - Titled `vt_snow` , this dataset contains daily snowfall data (in inches) from the years 2001 - 2023. These data points were collected from a weather station at the Mount Mansfield SCAN Site numbered 2041. Mount Mansfield is Vermont's largest mountain peak, located in the Green Mountains at an elevation of 4395'.


**Dataset 1: Sea Surface Temperature**

This data is average annual sea surface temperature (SST) from the years 2008 to 2012. This will be used to characterize the average sea surface temperature within the EEZ region.To find the averages for each year, I created a raster stack of each year titled `sst` (sea surface temperature).

This data was generated from [NOAA's 5km Daily Global Satellite Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly v3.1](https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/product/5km/index_5km_ssta.php)

**Dataset 2: Bathymetry**

This data is raster data characterizing the depth of the ocean, defined as a raster titled `depth`. 

This data was generated from [General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO)](https://www.gebco.net/data_and_products/gridded_bathymetry_data/#area).

## Final Results
I did x with the following inputs:

`species_name`: your species of interest. Note: this should be a realistic species for human commercial consumption.

`min_temp`: minimum suitable temperature in Celsius, found on [SeaLifeBase](https://www.sealifebase.ca/search.php)

`max_temp`: maximum suitable temperature in Celsius, found on [SeaLifeBase](https://www.sealifebase.ca/search.php)

`min_depth`: minimum meters below sea level for optimal growth, found on [SeaLifeBase](https://www.sealifebase.ca/search.php)

`max_depth`: maximum meters below sea level for optimal growth, found on [SeaLifeBase](https://www.sealifebase.ca/search.php)

The outputs of this analysis create...... 

In the example below, I am showing results for:

## Conclusion
To conclude, I am able to indicate that.... 

In a future analysis, I would aim to look at existing population data of oysters or other species in this area to help drive decisions on likely size, requirements, and budgets for a marine aquaculture project on oyster species. 


## Details of the Data Analysis 

For my data analysis, I completed a number of steps before getting to.... mapped suitable areas. These steps included cleaning, wrangling, plotting, and manipulating the datasets that I had. 

1. First, I needed to do some basic data cleaning. This included re-projecting my data to make sure all was using the same coordinate reference system to accurately compare and layer maps.  

2. Second, I calculated the mean sea surface temperature over the raster stacks and converted it to Celsius. This provided me with a raster of means for the entire West Coast. In order to just look at our Exclusive Economic Zones, I used `crop` to reduce the raster data to our area of interest. Then, because the resolution of the data did not match, I also used the nearest neighbor method using `resample` to make sure the resolutions matched and checked that the coordinate reference systems were the same.  

3. Third, I plotted the data. In the visualization below, I can see the variation in average sea surface temperatures in Celsius for the West Coast EEZ.
