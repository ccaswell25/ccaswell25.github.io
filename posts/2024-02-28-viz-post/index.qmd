## My Motivating Questions

My infographic (seen below) is a representation of my Strava data during marathon training. I started on this journey because I wanted to look back at my last marathon training and asked myself: How should I train for my next marathon?! Luckily, I had recorded all of my running data with the public online media platform called Strava. Strava has allowed me to keep all of my data on running and cross-training, which has been amazing to keep track of and learn about as I go. By analyzing my Strava data, some more detailed questions I will pursue are: When in my training should I ramp up my weekly mileage? What days during the week should I expect longer distances/need to allocate more time to running on those days? And lastly, what types of activities should I do to cross-train? I like to stay active beyond running, and wanted to look back at some of the other activities I’d done to balance getting miles in without road running. 

## About the Data

This data comes from my personal Strava data documented on the Strava web application. This application is a social network for tracking physical exercise via activities. Each logged data point represents an activity I have done; these activities range from running, hiking, surfing, skiing, walking, strength training, etc. In order to get this data from the public Strava app, I referenced the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/) . This includes utilizing the {{rStrava}} package. This package allowed me to scrape my data from the public Strava website by creating a Strava application and using authentication. Details on the scraped activity data included where I completed the activity, the duration of the activity, the type of activity, the title of the activity, the distance I went, the day/month/year I did the activity, the number of kudos received, and essentially anything recorded in a single Strava activity that I have access to. Then, I filtered my activity data down to my time period of interest, which was May to October 2023 (the time I was training for the marathon). 

## The Approach

My approach to this infographic is centered around one primary message: how to train for a marathon. This is represented by three pivotal themes: the training schedule, the expected distances to plan for, and cross-training considerations. In order to emphasize these three themes, I decided to select graphical forms that aligned with the message portrayal of these themes most clearly. 

By breaking up my infographic into three parts, I wanted the information to be digestible and catch the reader at each section. To do this, I started with the calendar in the top third since this is likely the most pivotal information that a person training for a marathon will need. Then, the middle third highlights some high level weekly distances and includes specific outlier events within my data.  The last third focuses on other complementary information for the individual who is training and if they are to consider cross-training in their larger marathon goals. This information is at the bottom because it is the least crucial/important when designing a marathon training plan. 
The approach to the training schedule was in the graphical form of a tile-like calendar. I chose this form because I wanted to clearly show peak days of the week with color that is easy to interpret. In this calendar, I am able to easily show that Thursdays, Fridays, and Sundays had the longest mile days, and Wednesdays and Saturdays typically had the least. This is a helpful way to inform someone training which days they can expect to have longer runs, shorter runs, and rest days. 

The approach to the second theme, weekly expected distances, is in the form of a line chart. This was in order to compare total values across weeks during training. The goal of this graph was to showcase changes in training with a ramp up period and a tapering period. The line chart provides a clear way to showcase the trends in this data, and including annotations allowed me to highlight any outlier weeks in my training due to life transitions, vacations, off weeks, etc. 

The approach to the third theme, cross-training considerations, was chosen to be in the form of a stacked bar chart. The colors in the bars of each training week allow the reader to have a clear visual of the different cross-training activities that are possible each week and where there are differences / changes across weeks. The bar chart provides a clear and concise option for viewing this type of data with colors emphasizing type of activity and bars emphasizing weekly trends.

The theme, colors, and typogrophy in my charts are focused on a bright contrast of an orange and black strava-related theme to emulate the branding of the app. I made sure to include color-blind friendly palettes when selecting the colors as to make this plot accessible to others. For my theme, I went with white text to stand out against the black background. I chose text that was big and bold and highlighted racing numbers, with the main/header font “League Spartan” and the small text font “Sanchez”. 

To put my data into context, I added the Strava logo and icons of running throughout the infographic to showcase the main purpose: running! I also incorporated running phrases and a running track to capture the reader at the beginning and throughout the different sections of the infographic. 
When considering a DEI lens on my infographic, it is limited in its impact to larger communities (given I am representing my own personal data). I want to acknowledge that being able to track data via Strava is not fully accessible to all since it is a mobile and web application. In order to graph this data and represent my own information, I am fortunate to have that luxury. I am also fortunate to have the opportunity and time to dedicate to training for a marathon, something not all people have the privilege of doing.
