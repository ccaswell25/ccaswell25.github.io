## My Motivating Questions

My infographic (seen below) is a representation of my Strava data during marathon training. I started on this journey because I wanted to look back at my last marathon training and asked myself: How should I train for my next marathon?! Luckily, I had recorded all of my running data with the public online media platform called Strava. Strava has allowed me to keep all of my data on running and cross-training, which has been amazing to keep track of and learn about as I go. By analyzing my Strava data, some more detailed questions I will pursue are: When in my training should I ramp up my weekly mileage? What days during the week should I expect longer distances/need to allocate more time to running on those days? And lastly, what types of activities should I do to cross-train? I like to stay active beyond running, and wanted to look back at some of the other activities Iâ€™d done to balance getting miles in without road running. 

## About the Data

This data comes from my personal Strava data documented on the Strava web application. This application is a social network for tracking physical exercise via activities. Each logged data point represents an activity I have done; these activities range from running, hiking, surfing, skiing, walking, strength training, etc. In order to get this data from the public Strava app, I referenced the Strava API . This includes utilizing the {{rStrava}} package. This package allowed me to scrape my data from the public Strava website by creating a Strava application and using authentication. Details on the scraped activity data included where I completed the activity, the duration of the activity, the type of activity, the title of the activity, the distance I went, the day/month/year I did the activity, the number of kudos received, and essentially anything recorded in a single Strava activity that I have access to. Then, I filtered my activity data down to my time period of interest, which was May to October 2023 (the time I was training for the marathon). 

## The Approach

TBD

## Preliminary Data Analysis

#### Reading in the Data

```{r  message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Loading Libraries ---
library(rStrava)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(paletteer) #for color palettes
library(patchwork)
library(magick)
library(ggpubr)
library(png)
```

```{r  message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Reading in Data ---
#strava_activities <- read_csv("strava_activities.csv")
```


#### Data Wrangling
