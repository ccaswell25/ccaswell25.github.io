    "\n",
    "The Thomas Fire was a wildfire that occured in December 2017 in Santa Barbara County and it had devastating impacts on the community. Knowing the risks, dangers, and effects of wildfires on populated areas, my analysis aims to visualize data surrounding key aspects of wildfires: the damage to the physical area and the air quality. In order to to do this, I will create a false color image to understand the burn area of the Thomas fire in 2017 as well as create a visualization to show the impact of air quality in Santa Barbara during the time period of the fire.  \n",
