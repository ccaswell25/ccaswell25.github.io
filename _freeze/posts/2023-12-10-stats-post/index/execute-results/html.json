With climate change being a major contributor in rising temperatures across the globe, lack of snowfall has become a serious problem that researchers, scientists, economists, and industry experts are working to solve. Snowfall is an important climate change indicator because of it's influence on the larger environmental community. Snowfall provides water sources in the Springtime for wildlife, the agriculture industry, and for human consumption. It is also a key contributor to the ski and tourism industry, which impacts the economy for some states that significantly rely on ski and snow tourism.\n\nVermont is one state that relies heavily on its winter tourism, so my aim was to analyze the changes in snowfall in this state. I have personally felt the impacts on lack of snow in recent years in this state, with limitations to skiing and ski resorts having to make more snow than ever before. My aim is to understand if there are seasonal temperature and snowfall differences in Vermont's yearly snow patterns by comparing data from the last 22 years.\n\n## Research Question\n\nIs there a statistically significant difference between the recent versus older trends in average snowfall and temperature changes in Vermont?\n\n## Analysis Highlights:\n\n1.  Tidy and wrangle snowfall and temperature data\n2.  Visualize my data\n3.  Check for normality\n4.  Run two hypothesis tests\n5.  Complete a regression analysis\n\n## About the Data:\n\nI gathered daily snow depth and temperature data from the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service and National Water and Climate Center (<https://nwcc-apps.sc.egov.usda.gov/site-plots/#VT>). This data source contains two datasets:\n\nDataset 1 - Titled `vt_temps` , this dataset contains daily temperature data (in degrees Fahrenheit) from the years 2001 - 2023. These data points were collected from a weather station at the Mount Mansfield SCAN Site numbered 2041. Mount Mansfield is Vermont's largest mountain peak, located in the Green Mountains at an elevation of 4395'.\n\nDataset 2 - Titled `vt_snow` , this dataset contains daily snowfall data (in inches) from the years 2001 - 2023. These data points were collected from a weather station at the Mount Mansfield SCAN Site numbered 2041. Mount Mansfield is Vermont's largest mountain peak, located in the Green Mountains at an elevation of 4395'.\n\n## Preliminary Data Analysis\n\nFor my data analysis, I completed a number of steps before getting to my final results. Those steps included cleaning, wrangling, visualizing, and analyzing the datasets that I had.\n\n#### Reading in the Data\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) #for tidying my data\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(tufte)\nlibrary(feasts)\nlibrary(dplyr) #for wrangling\nlibrary(dotwhisker) #for pretty plotting\nlibrary(plotly) #for plotting\nlibrary(lubridate) #for extracting specific years/months in the data\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(ggmap)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(zoo) #moving averages\n\n# Setting my filepath here:\nrootdir <- (\"~/Documents/MEDS/Fall_Q2/EDS-222-Stats/Assignments\")\ndatadir <- file.path(rootdir,\"eds222-final\",\"data\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvt_temps <- read_csv(file.path(datadir,\"Mount_Mansfield_temps.csv\"))    \nvt_snow <- read_csv(file.path(datadir,\"Mount_Mansfield_snow.csv\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Data Cleaning\n\nAfter reading in the data, I noticed both datasets were not tidy, so I completed a number of steps to tidy the data into a usable format.\n\n##### Temperature Data Updates\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Making this data tidy using pivot_longer\ntidy_vt_temps <- vt_temps %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c('2001', '2002', '2003', '2004', '2005', '2006', '2007', '2011', '2012', '2013', '2014', '2015', '2016', '2017', '2018', '2021', '2022', '2023'), names_to = \"year\", values_to = \"value\") %>% \n  select(-'2009', -'2010', -'2019', -'2024') \n\n#Creating a combined date column since year and date are currently separate\ntidy_vt_temps$date <- paste(tidy_vt_temps$year, tidy_vt_temps$date, sep = \"-\")\nclass(tidy_vt_temps$date) #this column is still a character so this needs to be updated to a date\ntidy_vt_temps$date <- ymd(tidy_vt_temps$date)\nclass(tidy_vt_temps$date) #nice, using lubridate worked to make a date column\n```\n:::\n\n\n##### Snowfall Data Updates\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Making this data tidy using pivot_longer\ntidy_vt_snow <- vt_snow %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = c('2001', '2002', '2003', '2004', '2005', '2006', '2007', '2011', '2012', '2013', '2015', '2016', '2017', '2018', '2022', '2023'), names_to = \"year\", values_to = \"value\") %>% \n  select(-'2009', -'2010', -'2020', -'2024') \n\n#Creating a combined date column since year and date are currently separate\ntidy_vt_snow$date <- paste(tidy_vt_snow$year, tidy_vt_snow$date, sep = \"-\")\nclass(tidy_vt_snow$date) #it's still a character so this needs to be updated\ntidy_vt_snow$date <- ymd(tidy_vt_snow$date)\nclass(tidy_vt_snow$date) #nice, it's now a date column\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Data Wrangling\n\nAfter tidying the data, I wanted to take a look at it visually and narrow down the data I am going to work with:\n\n##### Temperature Data Updates\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#I have data for all months of the year\n#I've decided I want to compare just months November -

2023\nplot_ly(tidy_vt_snow_winter_years, \n        x = ~month_day, \n        y = ~snowfall, \n        color = ~as.factor(year), \n        type = \"scatter\",\n        mode = \"lines+markers\",\n        line = list(width = 1)) %>%\n  layout(title = \"Comparison of Snowfall on Mount Mansfield from 2001 to 2022\",\n         xaxis = list(title = \"Dates\"),\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Snowfall (in inches)\"),\n         legend = list(title = \"Year\"))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Taking a look at daily temperature from 2001 -

I also noticed that the peaks for snowfall recorded (in inches) tend to be much higher in the non-recent years (specifically 2001 and 2002). These two generalizations indicates that there may indeed be some differences in snowfall and temperature over the duration of time I have plotted.\n\nI also noticed that there are a few years where data is missing, so I will omit those years from my analysis.\n\nWith these conclusions, I'm able to narrow down my focus to sample and group a number of years to compare in my hypothesis testing. To do this, I will categorize my years into \"recent\" and \"non-recent\" based on the data that is available.Given there was quite sparse data for many years, with some years not even being in the dataset, I was limited to working with the years that did have complete data. Interestingly, I could not find information on the organization's website about why there were years missing or there were many NAs in the years that did have data.\n\nTherefore, for this analysis, I will indicate the \"recent\" grouping as years 2015, 2016, and 2022 since those years have the most data. The \"non-recent\" grouping I will indicate as years 2001, 2022, and 2003 due to completeness in the data. Time to do some statistical analyses!\n\n## My Statistical Analyses\n\nFor my question, I will consider differences in climate conditions (snowfall and temperature) in Vermont and conduct summary statistics, a simple hypothesis test, a linear regression model, and a decomposition. I am aiming to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the recent and non-recent years for both snowfall and temperature variables.\n\n### Summary Statistics\n\nBy bucketing my data into two groups, recent and non-recent (more information on why and how below), I can do an initial comparison of my two sample groups:\n\nSnowfall Table:\n\n| Years                         | Mean (inches) | Standard Deviation (inches) | Median (inches) |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|\n| Recent (2015,2016, 2022)      | 3.92          | 8.37                        | 0               |\n| Non-Recent (2001, 2002, 2003) | 8.61          | 11.48                       | 0               |\n\nTemperature Table:\n\n| Years                         | Mean (F) | Standard Deviation (F) | Median (F) |\n|-------------------------------|----------|------------------------|------------|\n| Recent (2015,2016, 2022)      | 42.28    | 18.83                  | 44.06      |\n| Non-Recent (2001, 2002, 2003) | 39.64    | 19.43                  | 41.18      |\n\nWith these initial summary statistics, I can already see differences in the means, standard deviation, and median for my two groups. Taking a look at the snowfall data, the mean and standard deviation snowfall values (in inches) are much lower in the recent years grouping than non-recent. This aligns with my initial assumption that snowfall in recent years is, on average, much more sparse than previous years. When comparing the temperature statistics, I also noted mean temperature values (in Fahrenheit) to be much higher in the recent years grouping than the non-recent years. This also aligns with my initial assumption that temperatures are increasing. Given temperature and snowfall are highly correlated due to our understanding of snowfall's reliance on the temperature threshold of 32 degrees Fahrenheit, it would make sense that with higher average temperature values the average snowfall would decrease since they are inversely related. Now that I have some initial summary statistics, I am going to run my hypothesis test!\n\nCode for calculating these values below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# I'm going to join my two datasets together first:\nvt_data <- merge(tidy_vt_snow_winter, tidy_vt_temps_winter, by = 'date')\n\n#Cleaning my datasets\nvt_data <- vt_data %>% \n  select(-\"Min.x\", -\"10%.x\",-\"30%.x\", -\"70%.x\", -\"90%.x\", -\"Max.x\", -\"Median (POR).x\", -\"year.x\", -\"month.x\", -\"Min.y\",-\"10%.y\", -\"30%.y\",-\"70%.y\",-\"90%.y\",-\"Max.y\",-\"Median (POR).y\") %>% \n  rename(year = \"year.y\", month = \"month.y\") %>%  #removing and renaming columns to tidy this dataframe \n  filter( year %in% c('2001', '2002', '2003', '2015', '2016','2022'))\n\nvt_data\n\n#Summarizing the snowfall and temperature data for recent years:\nvt_recent <- \n  vt_data %>% \n  filter(year %in% c('2015', '2016', '2022'))\n\nvt_recent_stats <- vt_recent %>% \nsummarise(snow_mean = mean(snowfall, na.rm = TRUE), snow_sd = sd(snowfall, na.rm = TRUE), snow_median = median(snowfall, na.rm = TRUE),temp_mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), temp_sd = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE), temp_median = median(temp, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n#visualizing the stats table:\nvt_recent_stats\n\n#Summarizing the snowfall and temperature data before for non-recent years:\nvt_non_recent <- \n  vt_data %>% \n  filter(year %in% c('2001', '2002', '2003'))\n\nvt_non_recent_stats <- vt_non_recent %>% \nsummarise(snow_mean = mean(snowfall, na.rm = TRUE), snow_sd = sd(snowfall, na.rm = TRUE), snow_median = median(snowfall, na.rm = TRUE),temp_mean = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE), temp_sd = sd(temp, na.rm = TRUE), temp_median = median(temp, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n#visualizing the stats table:\nvt_non_recent_stats\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Checking OLS Assumptions\n\nI am aiming to draw conclusions about the Vermont snow climate using this sample from Mount Mansfield of temperature and snowfall observations. In order to move forward with my statistical analyses and draw conclusions, I need to check my OLS assumptions. To do that, I am going to plot the distribution of my snowfall and temperature samples to check for normality before continuing.\n\n#### Temperature Distribution\n\n![Pictured: Visualizing Temperature Distribution](temp_hist.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n![Pictured: Visualizing Temperature QQ Plot](temp_qq.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\nThe temperature data is fairly symmetric and this distribution looks to be somewhat normally distributed, which means I'm not going to transform my data since it is relatively normal.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Temperature Distributions Check\n#Non recent years\nvt_hist_non <-\n  ggplot(vt_non_recent) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = temp)) +\nlabs(\n    title = \"Recent Temperature Distribution During November and December\",\n    x = \"Temperature (in Fahrenheit)\",\n    y = \"Frequency\"\n  )\nvt_hist_non\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Recent years\nvt_hist_recent <-\n  ggplot(vt_non_recent) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = temp)) +\nlabs(\n    title = \"Recent Temperature Distribution During November and December\",\n    x = \"Temperature (in Fahrenheit)\",\n    y = \"Frequency\"\n  )\nvt_hist_recent\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#QQ Plot for Temperature\nggplot(vt_data, aes(sample = temp)) +\n  geom_qq() +\n  geom_qq_line() +\n  ggtitle(\"Q-Q Plot for Temperature\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Snowfall Distribution\n\n![Pictured: Visualizing Snowfall Distribution](temp_hist.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n![Pictured: Transformed Snowfall QQ Plot](snowfall_qq.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\nInteresting! The snowfall data was is fairly skewed to the right and there is a large right tail. This makes sense given the sheer volume of zeros in the data. Given this does not show me a normal distribution, I transformed the data using log() and created a QQ plot to see how how this non-normal distribution fits. Although my QQ plot is not perfect, I am happy with moving forward given the number of low values in my dataset (0s and 1s) which makes sense contextually since we are dealing with daily snowfall.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Creating histograms of my snowfall distribution to check for normality:\n#Snowfall Distributions Check\n#Non recent years\nvt_hist_non <-\n  ggplot(vt_non_recent) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = snowfall)) +\nlabs(\n    title = \"Recent Snowfall Distribution During November and December\",\n    x = \"Snowfall (inches)\",\n    y = \"Frequency\"\n  )\nvt_hist_non\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Recent years\nvt_hist_recent <-\n  ggplot(vt_non_recent) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(x = snowfall)) +\nlabs(\n    title = \"Recent Snowfall Distribution During November and December\",\n    x = \"Snowfall (inches)\",\n    y = \"Frequency\"\n  )\nvt_hist_recent\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Both recent and non-recent look relatively similar in their underlying distributions, so I'm going to plot just recent data.\n##QQ Plot for Snowfall\nggplot(vt_recent, aes(sample = snowfall)) +\n  geom_qq() +\n  geom_qq_line() +\n  ggtitle(\"Q-Q Plot for Snowfall\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##Transformed QQ Plot for Snowfall\nlog_snowfall <-log(vt_recent$snowfall)\nlog_snowfall_non <- log(vt_non_recent$snowfall)\n\nggplot(vt_recent, aes(sample = log_snowfall)) +\n  geom_qq() +\n  geom_qq_line() +\n  ggtitle(\"Q-Q Plot for Transformed Precipitation Data\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow that I have checked for normality and updated data where it was needed, I'm going to go ahead and run my hypothesis tests.\n\n### Hypothesis Testing\n\n#### Snowfall Hypothesis\n\nIs the mean snowfall in inches different in recent years than in previous years?\n\nMy null and alternative hypotheses:\n\n$$H_{O}: \\mu_{recent} - \\mu_{nonrecent} = 0$$\n\n$$H_{A}: \\mu_{recent} - \\mu_{nonrecent} \\neq 0$$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Categorizing data\nvt_data$category <- ifelse(vt_data$year %in% c(2015, 2016, 2022), \"recent\", \"not\")\n\n#Running a t.test on the filtered data:\nresult <- t.test(snowfall ~ category, data = vt_data, conf.level = 0.95)\nprint(result)\n\n#Extracting my confidence interval\nconf_interval <- result$conf.int\nprint(paste('I am 95% confident the range', round(conf_interval[1], 2), 'and',  round(conf_interval[2], 2), 'contains the true population difference between recent and non recent years for average snowfall in inches on Mount Mansfield.'))\n```\n:::\n\n\n![Pictured: Welch's Two Sample T Test Results](snowfall_ttest.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n**To conclude, my Welch's two sample t test generates a p value of .000000058 with a significance level of .05.

Given this analysis was completed using one weather station for duration of 20 years, I'd like to acknowledge that changes could have occurred to the monitor's position, measurement variability, and quality since snowfall is a quite sensitive variable.\n\n### Linear Regression\n\nI decided to expand my dataset again and include all years to compare the relationship between snowfall and temperature. Knowing that this relationship should be fairly intuitive since snowfall relies on a temperature threshold to exist (proven scientifically), I wanted to see the relationship that is present in this data.\n\n![Pictured: Running a Linear Regression with Results](lm_results.png){width=\"50%\"}\n\n**Intercept: When the average temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit, the snowfall is, on average, 20.6 inches between 2001-2023.**\n\n**Slope: For every 1 degree increase in temperature each day, the rate of snowfall decreases by .35.**\n\n**R-Squared: With an r-squared value of .40, I can conclude that 40% of snowfall in inches can be explained by temperature alone.**\n\nCode for this analysis below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# I'm going to join my larger datasets together first:\nvt_all_years_data <- merge(tidy_vt_snow_winter, tidy_vt_temps_winter, by = 'date')\n\n#taking a look at the data:\nvt_all_years_data <- vt_all_years_data %>% \n  select(-\"Min.x\", -\"10%.x\",-\"30%.x\", -\"70%.x\", -\"90%.x\", -\"Max.x\", -\"Median (POR).x\", -\"year.x\", -\"month.x\", -\"Min.y\",-\"10%.y\", -\"30%.y\",-\"70%.y\",-\"90%.y\",-\"Max.y\",-\"Median (POR).y\") %>% \n  rename(year = \"year.y\", month = \"month.y\")\nvt_all_years_data\n#aggregating all years of data for snowfall and temp:\n\n#running a simple regression on snowfall and temperature variables for my sampling years\nsummary(lm(snowfall ~ temp, data = vt_all_years_data))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Conclusion & Future Considerations\n\nTo conclude, and as shown above, there is no evidence to conclude statistically significant changes in average temperature data on Mount Mansfield from the years 2001 - 2023. There is evidence to suggest statistically significant changes in average snowfall in inches on Mount Mansfield from 2001 - 2023. However, as I also outlined above, there are a number of considerations with this data that could limit making any conclusions, including other variables present when gathering this data and missing years of data.\n\nThese conclusions align with my initial presumption that snowfall was declining in Vermont through my experiences skiing in recent years and also aligns with recent news stating the winter tourism industry is suffering from lack of snow. This analysis could be helpful for future ski industry stakeholders in determining how to budget and maintain mountains in the future. This analysis could also be helpful in determining mitigation plans for areas where snowfall is a significant contributor to spring water sources for agriculture, wildlife, and humans. It's important we acknowledge these changes to our environment and consider what the future of our world may look like with less snowfall.\n\nIn a future analysis, this data would be helpful in doing the following:\n\n-   Time series forecasting to predict future snowfall patterns\n\n-   Event analysis by understanding specific events in the time series like massive storms, El Niño/La Niña considerations \n\n-   A seasonal decomposition with a larger time frame of data\n\n-   Expanding the analysis regionally, nationally, or globally with more data\\\n\n## Sources:\n\nThe Boston Globe.
