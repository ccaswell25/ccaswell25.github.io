I started on this journey because I wanted to look back at my last marathon training and asked myself: How should I train for my next marathon?! Luckily, I had recorded all of my running data with the public online media platform called Strava. Strava has allowed me to keep all of my data on running and cross-training, which has been amazing to keep track of and learn about as I go. By analyzing my Strava data, some more detailed questions I will pursue are: When in my training should I ramp up my weekly mileage? What days during the week should I expect longer distances/need to allocate more time to running on those days? And lastly, what types of activities should I do to cross-train? I like to stay active beyond running, and wanted to look back at some of the other activities Iâ€™d done to balance getting miles in without road running. \n\n## About the Data\n\nThis data comes from my personal Strava data documented on the Strava web application. This application is a social network for tracking physical exercise via activities. Each logged data point represents an activity I have done; these activities range from running, hiking, surfing, skiing, walking, strength training, etc. In order to get this data from the public Strava app, I referenced the Strava API . This includes utilizing the {{rStrava}} package. This package allowed me to scrape my data from the public Strava website by creating a Strava application and using authentication. Details on the scraped activity data included where I completed the activity, the duration of the activity, the type of activity, the title of the activity, the distance I went, the day/month/year I did the activity, the number of kudos received, and essentially anything recorded in a single Strava activity that I have access to. Then, I filtered my activity data down to my time period of interest, which was May to October 2023 (the time I was training for the marathon). \n\n## The Approach\n\nTBD\n\n## Preliminary Data Analysis\n\n#### Reading in the Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Loading Libraries ---\nlibrary(rStrava)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(paletteer) #for color palettes\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(magick)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nlibrary(png)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Reading in Data ---\n#strava_activities <- read_csv(\"strava_activities.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Data Wrangling\n\n## Final Result\n\n### Visualization 1\n\n### Visualization 2 \n\n### Visualization 3\n\n",
